Face Recognition Attendance System
This project implements a face recognition attendance system designed to capture and record the entry and exit times of individuals. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works:

Features
Face Capture: The system captures an image of the person when they enter the premises.
Name Recording: The individual's name is recorded and linked with the captured image.
Database Storage: All details, including the image, name, entry time, and exit time, are stored in a database for record-keeping and further analysis.
Time Logging: The system accurately logs the time of entry and exit for each individual, ensuring precise attendance tracking.
How It Works
Image Capture: When a person enters, the system captures their image using a camera.
Name Entry: The system prompts the user to input their name.
Database Update: The captured image, name, entry time, and exit time are stored in the database.
Exit Tracking: When the person exits, the system updates the database .
